# UError (from the Unilib Library)

Unilib is a general utility library for writing scalable JavaScript applications. It's intended to be lightweight, flexible, Ã  la carte (i.e., install/import only what you need), and it strives to be mostly isomorphic/universal (i.e., can be used client-side or server-side).

This sub-package includes UError, a generic error class with support for supplying arbitrary instance properties which may provide additional context about the error that has occured.

Notes:

- This module is written in TypeScript and compiled to ES6-compatible JavaScript
- While this module has 100% unit test coverage and is being used in Production at a few companies, at this time, we cannot guarantee long-term support
